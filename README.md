## Introduction

The team came up with the business problem after coming across a dataset on pateints admitted to a hospital for a suspected stroke. For many of these incidents, it is a first time occurence, so making patients aware of the factors that possibly put them at risk is important. With that being said, not all individuals have easy access to healthcare, therefore implementing a federal program to bring awareness to those who may have a higher risk can benefit indivudals regardless of their insurance or financial status. The product idea we came up with is a machine learning model that can identify whether or not patients in this dataset had a stroke or not, and of those people that are stroke positive, what factors do they have in common. We ran several types of models and decided that logistic regression best suited our business problem and analyses.



## Business Problem

This model can be marketed towards federal health organizations such as Medicaid or public hospitals to reach out to their communities. These organizations can conduct outreach programs using the outcomes from this data model to inform the public and instruct those identified as high risk to ensure they are getting regular checkups and are aware of the warning signs. In the US, many of these public health programs are underfunded and have limited availability, such as waitlists for appointments, so having a product that can inform patients is essential for public health.


## Data Set

Our dataset is from Kaggle, a public, open-source site, and includes patients admitted to the hospital for a possible stroke. The factors include gender, age, hypertension, BMI, heart disease, occupation, residence type, average glucose level, and smoking status. Our target variable is whether or not the patient had a stroke (0 or 1).

## Navigating the Repo

To fork the repo, select fork in the top right corner and fill out the desired fields such as name and description (optional), then hit create fork. 

Upon opening the repo you will find the main branch. By selecting the branch drop down in the top left, you can navigate to the other members branches. Each branch other than the main has its own notebook that the pair worked on, located in a folder titled 'notebooks', as well as another folder labeled 'plots' containing images of each plot included in the notebook. The main contains a notebook that is compilation of all the members notes, as well as a pdf copy of the presentation and a csv containing the dataset.
